I think people would be hesitant to give up driving because it is a symbol of freedom and independence. However, I think people would be willing to try self-driving cars if they were proven to be safe and efficient. I think self-driving cars would influence our habits minimally. We would still be able to drive manually, so we would still need to know how to drive, and some would do it for fun such as racing. We could get robots to play sports for us but that would not be as interesting to watch because we would be unable to connect to a robot, or computer on an emotional level. However, self-driving cars would make it easier for us to get around and would allow us to be more productive.
