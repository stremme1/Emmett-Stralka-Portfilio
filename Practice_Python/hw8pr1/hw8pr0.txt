I agree that algorithms are subjective as a judge of human beings. While algorithms can provide objective results, they are often based on subjective data and assumptions. This means that the results of an algorithm can be biased or skewed. I think that algorithms have the potential to make human interactions fairer. By providing objective results, they can help to reduce bias and discrimination. However, there is also the potential for algorithms to be used in a way that leads to less fairness or less attention to fairness. For example, if an algorithm is used to automatically screen job applicants, it could inadvertently discriminate against certain groups of people. Take this example, "Discriminating on the basis of gender is not." In this case, the algorithm is not being used in a way that leads to fairness or attention to fairness. Instead, it is being used in a way that could lead to discrimination.
