“So Theory isn't dead yet, but it's changing -  perhaps beyond recognition.” 

Theory will never die; it will only change by its own usefulness. Theory is used to make the rules; however, once the rules are converted to algorithms, theory is forgotten, and data takes over. With a plethora of data, you can create your own theories, some even better than a psychologist. I agree that neural networks create a black box where the use of theories is less clear or beyond recognition. Humans are comfortable with theory-based machines because that is how we communicate with others, but it is not how we think. To push beyond a boundary is frightening; it requires a connection between communication and thought. 

The change should come as familiar, though. Our brain is a neural net, after all. That is where the AI algorithm got its name, and we are, what appears to be no less, closer to understanding it. So are we all not all carrying around a black box between our ears, and for the sake of human health, open it up to look inside?
