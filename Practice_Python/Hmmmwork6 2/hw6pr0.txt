I lean towards Tristan Harris's position on the ethics of the "attention economy". I think that the way that technology is designed, and the way that we use technology, can have a profound impact on our attention and our ability to focus. I think that we need to be more protective and responsible for our technology and social media use. Tristan Harris really sums this up. I think that smartphones are designed to be addictive, and that the companies that make them are more interested in keeping us coming back because the advertisers. I think that this quote from the article really sums up my position on this issue. " It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned." I think that the people who are creating these technologies are starting to realize the potential negative impact that they can have, and are taking steps to protect themselves and their families from it.
