# Example1 is an example program that 
#   1) asks the user for two inputs
#   2) computes the product of the inputs
#   3) prints out the result (with write)
#   4) stops

00 read r1          # get number from user to r1
01 read r2          # ditto, for r2
02 mul r3 r1 r2     # r3 = r1 * r2
03 write r3         # print what's in r3
04 halt             # stop
