% Create spline objects for D and L functions

Lspline = spline(powerlinedata(:,1),powerlinedata(:,3)); % construct spline object

% For convenience, create functions that can be used to evaluate D and L at any angle, even ones outside the [0,2*pi] range.
% Since the D and L functions are supposed to be periodic, we use mod( ,2*pi) to make sure that the angle is always between
% 0 and 2*pi, even if the inputted angle is outside of that range. That way the spline object is only evaluated where we
% have data specified in powerlinedata.
